Hi! Welcome to my personal page!

## About me

I am currently a masters student studying at UCI, and I have taken my undergrad in Computer Science with a focus in Security in [UMD](https://www.umd.edu/)

I like going on hikes with friends and visiting interesting landmarks with my family. &nbsp;

I like playing the guitar, cooking, swimming and going to the beach &nbsp;

## About this website
Click "websiteHost" on the side if the home button dissappears for some strange reason &nbsp;

It is currently under construction please come back soon &nbsp;

This website is quite buggy and I will finish it whenever I wish to work again on it (nav bar is broken)
