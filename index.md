# Richard Gao's Personal Website

Hi! Welcome to my personal page!

## About me

I am currently a masters student studying at the University of California Irvine, and I have taken my undergrad in Computer Science with a focus in Security, along with a minor in mathmatics in [University of Maryland College Park](https://www.umd.edu/). I am always interested in learning and discovering new things.

## About this website
Click "websiteHost" on the side if the home button dissappears for some strange reason &nbsp;

It is currently under construction please come back soon &nbsp;

This website is quite buggy and I will finish it whenever I wish to work again on it (nav bar is broken)
